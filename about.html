          Hello! My name is <strong>Andrelle Beverly</strong>, and I’m a 17-year-old student based in Peoria, AZ. I have a passion for gaming, coding, and constantly exploring new challenges. Whether I’m building a new project or strategizing in a game, I love to immerse myself in problem-solving and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently a high school senior, graduating early from Primavera High School, and working towards a coding certification at West-MEC. My goal is to develop my skills further and pursue a career in technology where I can combine my interests in programming and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding or gaming, I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching tutorials to improve my coding skills, and exploring the latest tech trends. I also have a strong sense of teamwork, developed through my experience as a basketball team captain, and I value collaboration in everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my website! Feel free to explore my projects, resume, or reach out to connect. Let’s create something awesome together!
